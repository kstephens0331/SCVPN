# SACVPN Deployment Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22
**Latest Deployment:** Railway (commit 24b5483)

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES (Just Deployed)

### 1. Subscription Display Issue - FIXED
**Problem:** Billing page showed "No active plan" after successful checkout

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated `/api/checkout/claim` endpoint to create subscription in database
- Retrieves Stripe subscription and links it to user after login
- Updates Stripe metadata with user_id for tracking
- Works even if webhook fails (critical fallback)

**How It Works:**
1. User completes checkout ‚Üí pays successfully
2. User logs in on post-checkout page
3. Frontend calls `/api/checkout/claim` with session_id and email
4. Backend gets user ID, retrieves Stripe subscription, saves to database
5. Billing page now shows active subscription ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Test with fresh checkout

---

### 2. Email Service Migration - COMPLETED
**Changed:** Replaced Resend API with Google SMTP

**Configuration:**
- From: SACVPN <info@stephenscode.dev>
- Host: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587 (STARTTLS)

**Required Railway Environment Variables:**
```bash
SMTP_USER=info@stephenscode.dev
SMTP_PASS=[Google App Password]
```

**Next Step:** Generate Google App Password and add to Railway
See: [GOOGLE_SMTP_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SMTP_SETUP.md)

**Status:** ‚úÖ CODE DEPLOYED - Awaiting SMTP credentials

---

### 3. Webhook Debug Logging - ADDED
**What:** Added comprehensive debug logging to Stripe webhook handler

**Logs Now Include:**
- Raw body presence, type, and length
- Signature presence and length
- Buffer type verification
- Specific error for missing raw body

**Purpose:** Identify why webhook signature verification is failing

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Monitor Railway logs on next webhook event

---

## üîß CONFIGURATION NEEDED

### Railway Environment Variables to Add

```bash
# Google SMTP (for email delivery)
SMTP_USER=info@stephenscode.dev
SMTP_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop  # 16-char App Password from Google
```

**How to Get App Password:**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select Mail ‚Üí Other (Custom) ‚Üí Name: "SACVPN Railway"
3. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
4. Add to Railway variables

---

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Test 1: Subscription Display (CRITICAL)
1. Delete test user from all Supabase tables
2. Go to pricing page ‚Üí Click "Get Started" on any plan
3. Complete Stripe checkout with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Sign up / Log in on post-checkout page
5. **Check billing page** - Should show "Personal - active" (or selected plan)
6. **Check Railway logs** - Should see `[claim] Subscription linked to user`

**Expected Result:** Subscription shows immediately after claim ‚úÖ

---

### Test 2: Email Delivery (After SMTP Setup)
1. User logs in to dashboard
2. Click "Request WireGuard Key" on a device
3. **Check Railway logs** - Should see `VPN setup email sent`
4. **Check inbox** - Should receive email with .conf attachment and QR code

**Expected Result:** Email arrives within 30 seconds ‚úÖ

---

### Test 3: Device Config Generation
1. User creates new device in dashboard
2. Backend should auto-generate WireGuard keys
3. Config should be viewable/downloadable

**Current Status:** May still have 404 error - needs verification

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES (In Progress)

### Issue 1: Webhook Signature Verification Failure
**Status:** INVESTIGATING with debug logging

**Problem:** Stripe webhooks can't verify signature
```
No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload
```

**Impact:**
- Subscriptions created via claim endpoint (workaround in place) ‚úÖ
- Subscription updates/cancellations may not sync
- Not blocking critical flow anymore

**Next Step:**
- Monitor Railway logs with new debug logging
- Check if req.rawBody is being populated correctly
- Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Stripe dashboard

---

### Issue 2: Device Config 404 Error
**Status:** NEEDS TESTING

**Problem:** GET /api/device/{id}/config-data returns 404

**Possible Causes:**
- No WireGuard keys generated for device
- Missing entry in device_configs table
- Key generation flow not triggered

**Next Step:** Test device creation flow and check logs

## üîç MONITORING

**Railway Logs to Watch:**
- `Email service initialized with Google SMTP` - Email config loaded
- `[claim] Subscription linked to user` - Subscription created successfully
- `VPN setup email sent` - Email delivered
- `[webhook] verify failed` - Webhook still failing (expected for now)
- `[webhook] Debug: raw body info` - New debug logging

**Stripe Dashboard:**
- Check subscription metadata has user_id after claim
- Verify webhook events are being sent
- Monitor successful payments

---

## üìù NOTES

- **Webhook failure is not blocking** - Claim endpoint handles subscription creation
- **Email service ready** - Just needs SMTP credentials
- **All Stripe Price IDs configured** - All 25 prices (5 plans √ó 5 billing periods)
- **VPN servers configured** - Dallas Central + VA Primary with SSH management

---

**Status:** üü¢ Major issues resolved - Ready for testing
**Next Review:** After SMTP setup and subscription display test
