## ⏳ PENDING ITEMS (User Actions Required)

### 1. VPN Node Physical Deployment 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**User must complete:**
- [ ] SSH into VA Primary (135.148.121.237)
- [ ] Install WireGuard: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y wireguard`
- [ ] Deploy server config with generated keys
- [ ] Start WireGuard: `systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0 && systemctl start wg-quick@wg0`
- [ ] Repeat for Dallas Central (45.79.8.145)

**Blocker:** System cannot generate client keys until this is complete
**Guide:** See `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`

---

### 2. Railway Environment Variables 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**User must add to Railway:**
- [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` - For email notifications (get from resend.com)
- [ ] `VPN_NODE_SSH_PASSWORD` - Already known: `78410889Ks!`
- [ ] `SCVPN_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - User already has this
- [ ] `SITE_URL` - Already set: `https://www.sacvpn.com`

**Current Status:** Some variables missing, system will work but no emails sent

---

### 3. Code Deployment to Production 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**User must:**
- [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
- [ ] Railway will auto-deploy from GitHub
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeds
- [ ] Check logs for any errors

**Status:** All code committed locally (commit be1fc5c), needs push

---

### 4. Resend Email Service Setup 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**User must:**
- [ ] Create Resend account at https://resend.com
- [ ] Verify domain sacvpn.com
- [ ] Get API key
- [ ] Add API key to Railway environment variables

**Status:** Optional but highly recommended for user experience

---

### 5. Run Gaming Optimization SQL 🟢 **RECOMMENDED**
**User should run in Supabase SQL editor:**
```sql
UPDATE vpn_nodes
SET gaming_optimized = true, performance_tier = 'premium', priority = 1
WHERE name = 'SACVPN-VA-Primary';

UPDATE vpn_nodes
SET gaming_optimized = false, performance_tier = 'standard', priority = 2
WHERE name = 'SACVPN-Dallas-Central';
```

**Status:** Enhances gaming plan experience

---
