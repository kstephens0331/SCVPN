## 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (4 Steps)

### STEP 1: Deploy VPN Nodes (30 minutes)

**Open PowerShell and follow MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md**

Quick version:

**VA Primary:**
```powershell
ssh ubuntu@135.148.121.237
# Password: 78410889Ks!
```
Then paste commands from MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md (VA PRIMARY section)

**Dallas Central:**
```powershell
ssh root@45.79.8.145
# Password: 78410889Ks!
```
Then paste commands from MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md (DALLAS CENTRAL section)

---

### STEP 2: Add Railway Environment Variables (5 minutes)

Go to: https://railway.app/project/2b5f8eee-06d2-4e7f-b344-cf29580514e5

Click your **scvpn-api** service → **Variables** tab → Add these:

```bash
SCVPN_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imx0d3Vxam1uY2xkb3BrdXRpeWFrIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTgyOTk0NCwiZXhwIjoyMDcxNDA1OTQ0fQ.J0GjiUMfB5dtO6QItZvtQiSduNRLWZDcW5gDZL91fIc

VPN_NODE_SSH_PASSWORD=78410889Ks!

SITE_URL=https://www.sacvpn.com
```

**(Optional - can add later):**
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=<create account at resend.com first>
```

---

### STEP 3: Push Code to GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash
cd "c:\Users\usmc3\OneDrive\Documents\Stephens Code Programs\sacvpn-web"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically deploy! Wait ~2-3 minutes for deployment.

---

### STEP 4: Test End-to-End (10 minutes)

1. **Check API is healthy:**
   ```bash
   curl https://scvpn-production.up.railway.app/api/wireguard/health
   ```

2. **Check nodes are visible:**
   ```bash
   curl https://scvpn-production.up.railway.app/api/wireguard/nodes
   ```

3. **Test in dashboard:**
   - Go to https://www.sacvpn.com/login
   - Login with your account
   - Go to Devices
   - Add a test device
   - Click "Request Key"
   - Wait 5 minutes (or manually trigger)
   - Click "View Config"
   - Should see QR code!

4. **Manually trigger key processing:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://scvpn-production.up.railway.app/api/wireguard/process-requests
   ```

---

## ⏰ TOTAL TIME REQUIRED

- **VPN Node Deployment:** 30 minutes
- **Railway Config:** 5 minutes
- **Git Push:** 2 minutes
- **Testing:** 10 minutes

**Total: ~45 minutes to fully operational system!**

---

## 📋 OPTIONAL: Set Up Email Notifications

**When:** After basic system is working
**Time:** 15 minutes

1. Go to https://resend.com and create account
2. Add and verify your domain (sacvpn.com)
3. Get API key from dashboard
4. Add to Railway: `RESEND_API_KEY=re_...`
5. Test by requesting a key - you'll receive email!

**Without this:** Keys still generate, users just won't get emails (they can view config in dashboard)

---

## 📋 OPTIONAL: Run Gaming Node Optimization

**File:** `scvpn-api/migrations/002_optimize_gaming_nodes.sql`

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy SQL from the file
3. Run it
4. Gaming users will now prefer VA Primary node

---

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST (After Deployment)

Use `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for comprehensive testing, but here's the quick version:

- [ ] Both VPN nodes show in `/api/wireguard/nodes`
- [ ] Can request VPN key
- [ ] Key generation completes (check database)
- [ ] Can view config with QR code
- [ ] Can download .conf file
- [ ] Config imports into WireGuard app
- [ ] Can connect to VPN
- [ ] IP changes when connected
- [ ] Cron job processes keys automatically (wait 5 min)

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### VPN Nodes Won't Start
```bash
# Check WireGuard status
sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u wg-quick@wg0 -f

# Verify config
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

### Railway Deployment Fails
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify all env vars are set
- Confirm nixpacks.toml is in scvpn-api folder

### Key Generation Fails
- Check Railway logs for SSH errors
- Test SSH manually: `ssh ubuntu@135.148.121.237 "wg show"`
- Verify VPN_NODE_SSH_PASSWORD is correct

### Email Doesn't Send
- This is optional - system works without it
- Check RESEND_API_KEY is set
- Verify domain is verified in Resend
- Check Railway logs for email errors

## 📞 IF YOU GET STUCK

1. **Check the logs:**
   - Railway: Project → Deployments → View Logs
   - Supabase: Dashboard → Logs
   - VPN Servers: `sudo journalctl -u wg-quick@wg0`

2. **Review documentation:**
   - `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - What was built
   - `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md` - Server setup
   - `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - How to test
   - `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.md` - Environment config

3. **Test APIs manually:**
   ```bash
   curl https://scvpn-production.up.railway.app/api/healthz
   curl https://scvpn-production.up.railway.app/api/wireguard/health
   curl https://scvpn-production.up.railway.app/api/wireguard/nodes
   ```

4. **Check database:**
   - Supabase → Table Editor
   - Verify `vpn_nodes` has 2 active nodes
   - Check `devices` table for your test device
   - Look at `key_requests` for pending/completed status

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

You'll know everything is working when:

1. ✅ Both VPN nodes show as active in API
2. ✅ Can request key from dashboard
3. ✅ Key request shows "completed" in database
4. ✅ Config modal displays with QR code
5. ✅ Download button works
6. ✅ Config file imports into WireGuard

## 🚀 LAUNCH READY!

Once Steps 1-4 are complete, your VPN service is **100% operational** and ready for customers!

**Remaining work can be done post-launch:**
- Email notifications (nice-to-have)
- Telemetry collection (analytics)
- Node health monitoring (ops)
- Business team management (feature)
