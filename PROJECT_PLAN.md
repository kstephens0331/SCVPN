### QR Code Implementation
```javascript
import QRCode from 'qrcode';

async function generateQRCode(wgConfig) {
  const qrDataURL = await QRCode.toDataURL(wgConfig, {
    errorCorrectionLevel: 'M',
    type: 'image/png',
    width: 400,
    margin: 2
  });
  return qrDataURL; // Base64 image
}
```

### Cron Job Setup (Railway)

**Option 1: GitHub Actions** (Recommended)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/process-vpn-keys.yml
name: Process VPN Keys
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Every 5 minutes

jobs:
  process:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Process pending key requests
        run: |
          curl -f -X POST ${{ secrets.API_URL }}/api/wireguard/process-requests
```

**Option 2: Railway Cron Service**
- Deploy separate service with cron schedule
- Calls API endpoint every 5 minutes

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Issue 1: Stripe Webhooks Not Completing
**Problem:** Webhooks receiving events but not updating subscriptions properly
**Root Cause:** Likely missing fields or incorrect event handling
**Fix Plan:**
1. Add detailed logging to webhook handler
2. Verify webhook signature is valid
3. Test with Stripe CLI locally
4. Check RLS policies on subscriptions table
5. Ensure all required fields populated

### Issue 2: No Email System
**Problem:** Users don't receive setup instructions
**Fix Plan:**
1. Add Resend.com integration
2. Create email templates
3. Add email to key generation flow
4. Test delivery rates

### Issue 3: No QR Code Generation
**Problem:** Mobile users can't easily configure
**Fix Plan:**
1. Add `qrcode` npm package
2. Generate QR in config endpoint
3. Embed in email
4. Test on iOS/Android

### Issue 4: SSH Access for API
**Problem:** API needs to execute commands on nodes
**Fix Plan:**
1. Install sshpass on Railway
2. Add VPN_NODE_SSH_PASSWORD to env
3. Test SSH connectivity
4. Later migrate to SSH keys
