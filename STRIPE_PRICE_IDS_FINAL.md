## üö® COMMON MISTAKES

1. **Wrong Total Amount:**
   - 6-month: Total for 6 months, NOT per month
   - 2-year: Total for 24 months, NOT per month
   - Example: Personal 2-year should be $167.76 total, not $6.99

2. **Wrong Interval:**
   - 6 months = "Every 6 months" (not "Every month" √ó 6)
   - 2 years = "Every 24 months" (not "Every 12 months" √ó 2)

3. **One-Time vs Recurring:**
   - ALL prices must be **recurring subscriptions**
   - Do NOT create one-time payments

4. **Test vs Live Mode:**
   - Create these in **LIVE MODE**
   - Toggle is in top-right corner of Stripe dashboard
