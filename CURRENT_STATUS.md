## üö® BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Current Blockers:
- None! All credentials acquired, nodes registered

### Potential Risks:
1. **Network Interface Names** - May need to adjust ens3/eth0 in configs
2. **SSH Access from Railway** - sshpass may not work in Railway environment
   - **Mitigation:** Test SSH connectivity after Railway deploy
   - **Fallback:** Use Railway Shell to test manually

3. **Email Deliverability** - Need to verify domain for Resend
   - **Mitigation:** Set up Resend domain verification early
   - **Fallback:** Use Supabase Auth emails temporarily

### Known Issues:
- Stripe webhooks partially working (need debugging)
- No telemetry collection yet (not blocking)
- No automated cron yet (manual trigger works)

## üìû IMMEDIATE HELP NEEDED

**From User:**
1. Deploy VPN nodes (following manual steps)
2. Confirm when both nodes are running
3. Add env vars to Railway
4. Create Resend.com account (can do later)

**From Claude (Me):**
- Standing by for next steps
- Ready to debug any deployment issues
- Will test immediately when nodes are ready
