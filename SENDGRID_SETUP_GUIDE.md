   - URL: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders

   - Reply To: `info@stephenscode.dev`
   - Company Address: (your business address)
   - City: (your city)
   - State: (your state)
   - Zip: (your zip)
   - Country: United States

4. **Click:** "Create"

5. **Check your email** (info@stephenscode.dev)
   - You'll receive a verification link
   - Click it to verify

6. **Wait for approval** - Usually instant, sometimes takes a few minutes

### Option B: Domain Authentication (Advanced - Better for production)

If you want better deliverability and can add DNS records:

1. **Go to:** Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication ‚Üí Domain Authentication
2. **Follow the wizard** to add DNS records to stephenscode.dev
3. This gives you better email reputation

**For now, Single Sender is fine!**
