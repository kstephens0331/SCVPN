## üìù TRACKING YOUR PRICE IDs

Create a file with all your Price IDs in this format:

```javascript
// PERSONAL PLAN
export const STRIPE_PRICE_PERSONAL_MONTHLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_PERSONAL_6MONTH = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_PERSONAL_YEARLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_PERSONAL_2YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_PERSONAL_3YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// GAMING PLAN
export const STRIPE_PRICE_GAMING_MONTHLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_GAMING_6MONTH = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_GAMING_YEARLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_GAMING_2YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_GAMING_3YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// BUSINESS 10 PLAN
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS10_MONTHLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS10_6MONTH = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS10_YEARLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS10_2YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS10_3YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// BUSINESS 50 PLAN
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS50_MONTHLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS50_6MONTH = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS50_YEARLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS50_2YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS50_3YEAR = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// BUSINESS 250 PLAN
export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS250_MONTHLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

export const STRIPE_PRICE_BUSINESS250_YEARLY = "price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

```

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After creating all products/prices:

- [ ] 5 products created in Stripe
- [ ] Each product has 5 prices (25 total)
- [ ] All prices are **recurring** (not one-time)
- [ ] Intervals are correct (monthly, 6mo, 12mo, 24mo, 36mo)
- [ ] Amounts match the pricing table exactly
- [ ] All Price IDs copied and saved
- [ ] Products are in **LIVE MODE** (not test mode)

---

## üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Wrong Interval:** Make sure 6-month is "Every 6 months" not "Monthly"
2. **One-Time vs Recurring:** All prices must be RECURRING subscriptions
3. **Test Mode:** Create these in LIVE mode, not test mode
4. **Wrong Amount:** Double-check the total amounts (e.g., 2-year is total for 2 years, not per month)
5. **Missing Description:** Add descriptions so you can identify prices later

---
