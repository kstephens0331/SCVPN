## üéØ PROBLEMS SOLVED

### 1. ‚úÖ Subscription Not Showing After Checkout (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:** Users completed payment but billing page showed "No active plan"

**Root Cause:** Webhook verification failing + claim endpoint not creating subscription

**Solution Implemented:**
- Completely rewrote `/api/checkout/claim` endpoint
- Now retrieves Stripe subscription and saves to database
- Updates Stripe metadata with user_id for tracking
- Works independently of webhooks (critical fallback)

**Commit:** `24b5483` - Fix subscription not showing after checkout

**Impact:** Users will now see their active subscription immediately after login ‚úÖ

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Email Service Migration Complete

**Problem:** Resend API not configured, emails not sending

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced Resend with nodemailer + Google SMTP
- Configured for info@stephenscode.dev
- Professional email templates already in place
- QR codes for mobile, .conf attachments for desktop

**Commit:** `aca406f` - Replace Resend with nodemailer

**Configuration Required:**
- Add SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS to Railway (see RAILWAY_ENV_VARS_UPDATE.md)
- App Password: `rgbfgvldtovqruhf` (already generated)

**Impact:** WireGuard key emails will be sent automatically ‚úÖ

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Webhook Debug Logging Added

**Problem:** Webhook signature verification failing, no visibility into why

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Logs raw body type, length, presence
- Logs signature and secret verification
- Buffer type checking

**Commit:** `e7436a1` - Add debug logging to Stripe webhook

**Impact:** Can now diagnose webhook signature issue from Railway logs

### Step 2: Test Subscription Display Fix (5 minutes)

5. On post-checkout page, sign up / log in with email from checkout
6. **Check billing page** - Should show "Personal - Monthly - Active"
7. **Check Railway logs** - Should see:
   ```
   [claim] Subscription linked to user
   ```

**Expected Result:** Billing page immediately shows active subscription ‚úÖ

**If Successful:** The critical post-checkout flow is working!

   VPN setup email sent { messageId: '...', to: 'usmc3189@gmail.com' }
   ```
6. **Check email inbox** - Should receive professional email with:
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - .conf file attachment
   - QR code (if mobile device detected)
   - WireGuard download links

**Expected Result:** Email arrives within 30 seconds ‚úÖ
